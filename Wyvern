Goal:
Automatically detect height off ground, and use to determine when to deploy a drogue chute + main chute at minimum possible time to 
minimise wind effect on the craft


-Barometer
-Accelerometer
-SD logger
-433mhz transceivers for telemetry
BASED ON ARDUINO UNO (+Nano for ground telemetry)



Time to ground function? t= sqrt of s/(U+0.5a)
^from this, find minimum T to deploy main/drogue chute to minimise parachute descent time
